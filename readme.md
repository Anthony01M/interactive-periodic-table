## Note

I created this project as part of a coding challenge. The goal was to create an Interactive Periodic Table using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though the project is simple, I enjoyed working on it and learned a lot in the process.
This project may or may not contain some duplicates since I myself am not a chemistry expert. I have tried to keep the information as accurate as possible but there may be some mistakes. If you find any, please let me know so I can correct them.
